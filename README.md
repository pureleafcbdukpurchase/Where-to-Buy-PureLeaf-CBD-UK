<h3><strong>The Science Underpinning CBD Capsules&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>CBD (cannabidiol) enhances the&nbsp;<a href="https://nutragreenfarm.com/">endocannabinoid</a>&nbsp;system (ECS)&mdash;a complex framework of receptors (CB1 in the cerebral region and central nervous system; CB2 in the immune response), endogenous cannabinoids, and enzymes that collaboratively govern emotional state, discomfort, sleep, immunity, and additional physiological functions. In contrast to THC (which binds directly), CBD serves as a negative allosteric modulator of CB1 and CB2 receptors, subtly modifying their responsiveness to stimuli. CBD decelerates the decomposition of anandamide ("the bliss molecule"), enabling it to maintain its activity for an extended period, thereby aiding emotional well-being, alleviating stress, and managing pain. It influences serotonin, GABA, dopamine, and other neurotransmitters&mdash;contributing to a reduction in anxiety, enhancement of mood, and facilitation of sleep.&nbsp;</p>
